# Documentation

This is the starting point for our documentation. While it doesn't have much yet, we will use this repository to add not just the content that we publish on the [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TomazZaman) but also everything that we consider would be useful info for the community.

### Tutorials

- [Build a Debian Linux image from scratch](tutorials/linux-from-scratch.md)
